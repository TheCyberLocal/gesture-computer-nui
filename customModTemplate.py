"""
All external packages, such as this, are modules for the right hand
 since the left is meant to control which package the right uses and is not to be customized.
Notice that each finger on your hand corresponds to an r-code, r standing for right hand.
From thumb to pinky, the r-code is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.

Now that you understand the fundamentals of the r-code, let's see how to use it.
By choosing the correct functions below, you can write your own code,
 and it will run when the function is called by the hand gesture.
